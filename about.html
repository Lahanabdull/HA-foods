      <h4>Ayanoth Abdulla Haji</h4>
      <p>Founder of the company<br>
        In the 1990s, Abdulla Haji laid the foundation for Sanjeed Food Production Company with a clear vision and strong<br>
        values.Despite limited resources and tough market competition, he remained committed to quality and customer satisfaction.<br>
        With minimal machinery and manpower, he personally oversaw production, packaging, and delivery, building trust in the local<br> 
        community. One of the biggest challenges he faced was gaining market attention among larger brands, but his persistence, honesty,<br>
        and focus on traditional taste helped Sanjeed stand out.His efforts not only shaped the brandâ€™s identity but also inspired the next<br>
        generation to continue his legacy.
